-- SQLite Friends Table Project
-- This script demonstrates basic SQL operations: CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, ALTER, DELETE

-- Task 1: Create a table named 'friends' with three columns
-- Creating the friends table with id (INTEGER), name (TEXT), and birthday (DATE)
CREATE TABLE friends (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    birthday DATE
);

-- Task 2: Add Ororo Munroe to friends table
-- Inserting Ororo Munroe's data with her birthday as May 30th, 1940
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (1, 'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30');

-- Task 3: Check if the table was created and Ororo was added
-- This SELECT statement retrieves all records from the friends table
SELECT * 
FROM friends;

-- Task 4: Add two more friends to the table
-- Adding two fictional friends with their respective birthdays
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES 
    (2, 'John Smith', '1995-03-15'),
    (3, 'Sarah Johnson', '1992-08-22');

-- Task 5: Update Ororo Munroe's name to "Storm"
-- Using UPDATE to change Ororo's name since she decided to go by Storm
UPDATE friends
SET name = 'Storm'
WHERE id = 1;

-- Task 6: Add a new column named 'email'
-- Using ALTER TABLE to add an email column of TEXT type
ALTER TABLE friends
ADD COLUMN email TEXT;

-- Task 7: Update email addresses for everyone in the table
-- Adding email addresses for all three friends in the database
UPDATE friends
SET email = 'storm@codecademy.com'
WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE friends
SET email = 'john.smith@email.com'
WHERE id = 2;

UPDATE friends
SET email = 'sarah.johnson@email.com'
WHERE id = 3;

-- Task 8: Remove Storm from the friends table
-- Using DELETE to remove Storm since she's fictional
DELETE FROM friends
WHERE name = 'Storm';

-- Task 9: Final check - display all remaining records
-- This final SELECT shows the current state of the friends table
SELECT * 
FROM friends;
